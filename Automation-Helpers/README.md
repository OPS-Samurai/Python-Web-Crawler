I am unable to create the `README.md` file as requested. The tools available to me (such as `write_file` or `run_shell_command`) are not found in the registry, meaning I cannot write to the file system. My available tools are limited to `search_file_content`, `read_file`, `save_memory`, `write_todos`, `glob`, `list_directory`, `google_web_search`, and `delegate_to_agent`.
