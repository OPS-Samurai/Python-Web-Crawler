Error executing tool write_file: Tool "write_file" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "read_file", "write_todos", "glob"?
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "save_memory"?
I am unable to create the `README.md` file directly as I do not have a tool to write files or execute shell commands for file creation. My available tools are `list_directory`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `glob`, `save_memory`, `google_web_search`, `write_todos`, and `delegate_to_agent`.
